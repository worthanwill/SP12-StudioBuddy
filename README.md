# SP-12 Music Practice Scheduling - Studio Buddy
## About
Studio Buddy was originally developed by Kennesaw State University students during Fall 2022. This new repository contains the restructured project developed during Spring 2022.
## Installation
1. Install React Native on your machine. Follow the instructions for React Native CLI Quickstart located [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).
2. Download this project to a directory of your choice.
3. Run Windows Powershell as administrator. In Powershell, navigate to the project directory and run "npm install react-native". This will take some time.
4. There are a few extra dependencies that also need to be installed on to the project:
  a. React Navigation: In the project directory, run "npm install @react-navigation/native". Afterwards, run "npm install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context"
5. In Powershell, run "npx react-native start". Metro will start and allow you to install and run the app in a device/emulator of your choice.
